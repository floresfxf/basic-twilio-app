# basic-twilio-app
This is my basic application I made when first getting the hang of the Twilio API. It offers an extremely simple method of sending messages from a web application to a mobile device via SMS messaging.  

Since I have psoted this code to github, I have removed sensitive information such as my access token, account ID and account phone number. Cloning this repo and plugging in these values with your own information will solve this problem. If you don't have this, I highly encourage you to go check it out and [get an API key for free](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).  

To run, simply open `twilio.html`. This should act as great starter code for all messaging projects! Use this for 2-FA, chats, account verification, human verification, or anything! The possibilities are endless! Now go! Go Build! Change the world!
